# lolcommits (forked by nickw444)
This fork adds a new plugin for shell scripts. Using the plugin "shell", you
can execute a shell command on post-capture. It's first argument will be the
newly created image. This is useful for uploading to a web services via ssh,
or some other thing, without the need to get knee deep inside ruby. 

Additionally, this fork modifies configuration.rb to use a global config
instead, meaning you do not need to set up shell for each and every one of
your repositories. Just configure it once, and you're good to go (but you'll 
need to enable lolcommits on them though).

Enjoy!

(Btw, this probs won't ever be maintained. You can see the actual end of where
my commits end up at my [website](http://nickwhyte.com/))

# lolcommits (git + webcam = lol)

lolcommits takes a snapshot with your webcam every time you git commit code, and
archives a lolcat style image with it.  Git blame has never been so much fun.

By default, the lol images are stored by a Github style short SHA in a
`~/.lolcommits` directory created for you.

Please add your own lolcommit! Add to the [People Using
Lolcommits](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Lolcommits-from-around-the-world%21)
page on our wiki.

## Installation

### Mac OS X

You'll need ImageMagick installed. [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
makes this easy. Simply do:

	brew install imagemagick

Then install the gem with:

	[sudo] gem install lolcommits

If you're using RVM (or rbenv), you can/should probably omit the sudo, but the
default MacOSX Ruby install is dumb and requires it.

If [Boxen](https://boxen.github.com) is your thing, [try
this](https://github.com/AssuredLabor/puppet-lolcommits).

### Linux

Install dependencies using your package manager of choice, for example in
Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install mplayer imagemagick libmagickwand-dev

For Ubuntu 14.04 or newer, you need to manually install ffmpeg since it no longer ships with the default Ubuntu sources. [Downloads for ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

Then install the gem with:

    gem install lolcommits

For more details, see [Installing on
Linux](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Linux).

### Windows - here be dragons!

It all works but you'll need some more detailed instructions to get the
dependencies installed.  See the wiki page for [Installing on
Windows](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Installing-on-Windows).

## Usage

### Enabling and basic usage

From within any git repository, simply do a `lolcommits --enable`. From that
point on, any git commit will automatically trigger a lolcommit capture! All
lolcommits are stored in `~/.lolcommits` by default, placed in a subdirectory by
project name, and with a filename matching the commit hash.

You can also enable lolcommits across all your local git repos. Follow [these
steps](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Enabling-Lolcommits-for-all-your-Git-Repositories)
to achieve this using `git init` and the `init.templatedir` setting.

Don't worry about it too much, half the fun of lolcommits is forgetting it's
installed!

### Other commands

Ok, if you insist... Since you know about `--enable`, common sense suggests
there is also a repository specific `--disable`, hopefully you can guess what
that does. Other handy common commands include `--last`, which will open for
display your most recent lolcommit image, or `--browse`, which pops open the
directory containing all the lolcommit images for your current repository. You
can always do `--help` for a full list of available commands.

**NOTE**: Any extra arguments you pass with the --enable command are
auto-appended to the git-commit capture command.  For example;

    lolcommits --enable --delay=5 --animate=4 --fork

Will configure capturing of an animated gif (4 secs) after a 5 sec delay in a
forked process. See the section below for more capture configuration variables.

### Capture configuration variables

lolcommits has some capture options for additional lulz. You can enable these
via environment variables like so;

* `LOLCOMMITS_DEVICE` set a webcam device - **mac and linux only**
* `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE` (in seconds) set time for capturing an animated gif -
  **requires ffmpeg**
* `LOLCOMMITS_DELAY` (in seconds) set delay persistently (for slow webcams to
  warmup)
* `LOLCOMMITS_FORK` fork lolcommit runner (capture command forks to a new
  process, speedily returning you to your terminal)
* `LOLCOMMITS_STEALTH` disable notification messages at commit time
* `LOLCOMMITS_DIR` set the output directory (defaults to ~/.lolcommits)

Or they can be set via the following arguments in the capture command (located
in your repository's `.git/hooks/post-commit` file).

* `--device=DEVICE` or `-d DEVICE`
* `--animate=SECONDS` or `-a SECONDS`
* `--delay=SECONDS` or `-w SECONDS`
* `--fork`
* `--stealth`

To change the font (including point size, position & color), simply configure
the default loltext plugin with this command:

    lolcommits --config -p loltext

You can use `lolcommits --devices` to list all attached video devices available
for capturing. Read how to [configure commit
capturing](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Configure-Commit-Capturing)
for more details.

### Animated Gif Capturing

Animated gifs can take a while to generate (depending on the number of seconds
you capture and the capabilities of your machine).
[ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) is required and can be installed like so;

* Linux - [follow this guide](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-linux)
* OSX - `brew install ffmpeg`

To enable, just set the `LOLCOMMITS_ANIMATE` environment variable with the
number of seconds to capture. Like regular image captures you can use the env
variables `LOLCOMMITS_DEVICE` and `LOLCOMMITS_DELAY` to change the capture
device or delay time (seconds) before capturing.

If you find capturing an animated gif takes too long, try setting the
`LOLCOMMITS_FORK=true` env variable. Animated gif captures are currently NOT
supported on Windows.

### Plugins

A growing number of plugins are now available allowing you to transform or share
your lolcommits with others. The default plugin simply appends your commit
message and sha to the captured image. Others can auto post to Twitter, Tumblr
(and other services), or even translate your commit messages to
[lolspeak](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lolspeak). They can be
easily enabled, configured or disabled with our config command:

    lolcommits --config

Check them out on our [plugins
page](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/Configuring-Plugins).

## Troubles?

Try our trouble-shooting [FAQ](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki/FAQ), or
take a read through our [wiki](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/wiki) for
more information. If you think something is broken or missing, raise a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/issues) (and please take a little
time to check if we haven't [already
addressed](https://github.com/mroth/lolcommits/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
it).

## Timelapse?

To watch your face as it decays while you program, you can create a quick mpeg
of all your lolcommits snapshots (if you have `imagemagick` and `ffmpeg`
installed):

    convert `find . -type f -name "*.jpg" -print0 | xargs -0 ls -tlr | awk '{print $9}'` timelapse.mpeg
